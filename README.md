# AI-Financial-Chatbot
A rule-based Python chatbot that answers predefined financial queries

ðŸ”· Project Description:

This project involved the development of a rule-based AI chatbot designed to respond to predefined financial queries related to key metrics such as revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flow. The chatbot was built using Python and was focused on analyzing and presenting financial data from Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple over the last three fiscal years.
The chatbot utilizes a simple command-line interface to accept user input and return static responses based on previously analyzed financial reports (10-K filings). It simulates the behavior of an AI financial assistant while working within predefined queries for ease and clarity.

ðŸ”· Key Features:

â€¢	Built using Python with structured if-else logic.
â€¢	Supports 5 predefined financial queries:.
 o	Total Revenue.
 o	Net Income Change.
 o	Total Assets.
 o	Cash Flow from Operating Activities.
 o	Total Liabilities.
â€¢	Uses previously analyzed data for accurate canned responses.
â€¢	Developed in a case-insensitive format to improve user experience.
â€¢	Designed as a prototype for AI-powered financial assistance.

ðŸ”· Tools & Technologies Used:

â€¢	Python 3.13.3
â€¢	Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis)
â€¢	Command-Line Interface (CLI)
â€¢	Data Source: SEC EDGAR 10-K Filings (Manual Extraction)

ðŸ”· Limitations:

â€¢	The chatbot only supports static, predefined questions.
â€¢	It does not fetch real-time or dynamic data.
â€¢	No natural language processing (NLP) or AI learning involved in this version.

ðŸ”· Outcome:

This project laid the foundation for understanding the structure of AI-driven financial assistants.
It strengthened the learnerâ€™s ability to extract, analyze, and convert financial data into user-friendly interactions through programming, setting the stage for more complex AI chatbot development in the future.
