Financial Analysis Chatbot - Internship Project

Project Summary:
This is a basic Python-based prototype of an AI chatbot designed to respond to predefined financial queries using previously analyzed data from Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple.

Predefined Queries the chatbot understands:
1. What is the total revenue?
2. How has net income changed over the last year?
3. What are the total assets?
4. What is the cash flow from operations?
5. What are the total liabilities?

How it works:
- The chatbot uses simple if-else statements to respond.
- When a user enters a matching query, it returns the prepared data from the dictionary.
- If a query is not recognized, it informs the user accordingly.

Limitations:
- This is not a real-time AI chatbot.
- It only works with exact matches of 5 predefined queries.
- It cannot answer free-text or dynamic financial analysis questions.

Run Instructions:
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open terminal and run: python chatbot.py
3. Enter one of the listed queries or type 'exit' to quit.
